# DandyHacks_VirtualTetris
DandyHacks University of Rochester Spring 2016 Hackathon
Tetris game backed by the Leap-Motion Java API. Tetris game is controlled by hand movement and gestures over the Leap Motion controller. The program registers KeyEvents so it can be played without a Leap-Motion sensor but it is highly recommended!
