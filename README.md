# DandyHacks_VirtualTetris
DandyHacks Rochester Spring 2016 Hackathon
Java Tetris game backed by the Leap-MotionSDK Java API. Tetris game is controlled by hand motions and gestures over the leap controller. Program will register KeyEvents so game will work without the Leap-Motion sensor but it is highly recommended!
